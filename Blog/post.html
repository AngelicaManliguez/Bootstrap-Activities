                <br/><h1>My Goal</h1><br/>
                <p class="lead">As a third-year Computer Science student, my professional aspirations are finely tuned towards securing coveted positions at globally 
                    recognized tech giants such as Microsoft or Oracle. Within these esteemed companies, I aim to specialize in either Software Engineering or Data Analysis, 
                    leveraging my skills and knowledge to contribute meaningfully to cutting-edge projects and innovations.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Furthermore, my ambition extends beyond borders, with a keen interest in exploring career opportunities in Japan. This fascination is rooted in the vibrant
                    tech ecosystem and the numerous avenues for growth and development available within the Japanese tech industry. I am drawn to the dynamic work culture, 
                    the emphasis on innovation, and the opportunities to collaborate with top-tier professionals in my field.
                    <br/><br/>
                    The prospect of achieving these ambitious goals fills me with a sense of determination and pride. I am driven to excel academically and professionally, 
                    honing my skills, expanding my knowledge, and gaining valuable experiences that will prepare me for the challenges and responsibilities that lie ahead.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I recognize that realizing these aspirations requires unwavering dedication, hard work, and a continuous quest for learning and improvement. Therefore, I 
                    am fully committed to investing my time and energy into developing myself into a competent and accomplished professional who can make significant 
                    contributions to the field of Computer Science and thrive in diverse and dynamic work environments.</p><br/>

                <br/><h1>Want vs Need</h1><br/>
                <p class="lead">Initially, my plan was to pursue an Engineering course, a passion I've held since high school. However, upon graduating from Senior High School,
                    I conducted research on the current demand for different courses. Computing studies, particularly IT and Computer Science, consistently ranked among the top 
                    choices. This led me to delve into why these fields are in high demand nowadays, and I discovered that technology is constantly advancing. I then compared 
                    the job prospects and salary potential between Computer Science and Civil Engineering, finding that Computer Science typically offers higher salaries and is 
                    preferred by many online. After much contemplation for almost a month, I ultimately decided to pursue a degree in Computer Science. This decision was 
                    influenced by observing successful individuals, some of whom are my friends, thriving in their Computer Science careers and enjoying financial stability at 
                    a young age. I am now dedicated to studying diligently to excel in my chosen field.
                    <br/><br/>
                    As an individual, I prioritize what I need over what I want. This led me to shift my dream from becoming an engineer to becoming a successful graduate in 
                    Computer Science, with a desired job and a high salary.</p><br/>

                <br/><h1>Pressure</h1><br/>
                <p class="lead">As a first child who going to graduate among our family, the pressure is heavy behind my back. My eager to graduate immediately is high to the 
                    point that I always imagine my graduation day, what my future become, and how I am going to spoil my mom. I want to help my mom so much. I tried to work at 
                    McDonalds to help but my grades are getting low. Its so hard to work and study at the same time. It affected my grades to the point that I am now removed 
                    at the candidate of Cum Laude. Which is one of the sad moments of my life because one of my dreams is to have my mom in stage in my graduation day and 
                    wearing to me the medal. </p><br/>
